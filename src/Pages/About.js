    <div>    You had me at “Well hello there.”</div>

    <div> Well, that’s exactly how the About Us section of Eight Hour Day starts – a welcoming greeting.</div>

    <div> For that reason, it also made us browse for more.</div>

    <div> Why?</div>

    <div> Because as much as you love good design and inspiring illo want to t the people that curate all the content for you.</div>

    <div> Furthermore, it’s equally rewarding when you realize that they are just as eager to start a visual dialogue with you.</div>

    <div> Nathan Strandberg and Katie Kirk are doing what makes them happy, and this is obvious throughout their page.</div>
